 *
 * There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space.
 * For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the
 * horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and
 * hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is
 * always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
 *
 * An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the
 * x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if
 * xstart â‰¤ x â‰¤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be
 * shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to
 * find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 * [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
 *
 * Output:
 * 2
 *
 * Explanation:
 * One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons
 * [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two
 * balloons).
